# Made from lines

This application is based on the [processing programming environment](https://processing.org). With Made-from-lines you can load pictures into the application
and generate a creative line drawing. There are some controls to tweak the result.

The internal algorithm is already included to my [image-processing library](https://github.com/Milchreis/processing-imageprocessing), if you want to use it in your own project.

If you like this project and you want to keep me awake ðŸ¤ª

## Usage

Clone this repository into your sketchbook and open it up. Make sure you have the "image-processing" library installed ([more here](https://github.com/Milchreis/processing-imageprocessing)).
In that way you can change the code as you need it.

If you dont want to change anything, you can download [here](https://github.com/Milchreis/madeFromLines/releases) the latest build. You need
an installed java runtime editon (JRE) on you computer to run this application.

## TODOs

 * Loading and writing pictures take some time. The user should see a waiting dialog
 * Support window resizing
 * Export PNG with translucent background
